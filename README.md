# Bikes-Ride-Analysis
Analysing the differences in bikes usage between two customer segments of a Bike Share company


## Introduction
Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the management believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to the company’s future growth. Also, it will save the company’s acquisition cost of new customers. For that reason, the management team has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## Objectives of the Analysis
Objectives of the task are to:

i.  Understand how annual members of the company and casual riders differ in terms of the company’s bikes usage

ii. Make recommendations on how to convert casual riders to annual members

This will be done by analysing the historical data of the company to identify trends in bikes' usage by these two different customer segments.

Understanding how these two different subscribers act will help the company's stakeholders have a clear idea of how they can convert the casual bikers to annual members. The key stakeholders include; the shareholders of the company looking to increase their company’s valuation, the management team, the company’s employee that will benefit from the company’s expansion and growth, and the customers of the company that will continue to get value by using the company's services.
